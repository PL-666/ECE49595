# SB Land
A senior design for the course ECE 49595OS at Purdue University.

## Project Description
SB Land, short for Stack and Build Land, is a card survival game. In SB Land, you can stack cards to collect food, build structures, and defend your territory. For example, dragging a villager card on top of a Berry Bush card will spawn Berry cards which the villagers can eat to survive.
The idea comes from a game called Stacklands, which is also a card survival game. However, the game is easy to begin with but hard to master, and there are some potential problems in this late game like too many operations. Based on this idea, we decided to make our own version.

## How to play
You can check the `user_manual.md` (WIP)

## What we have done
There are three major modifications. First, we will add a background story, which gives players a target for winning the game. Next, we will also introduce simplified mechanisms. Secondly, we decided to limit the total number of villagers the player can have to limit the development speed and extend the game's lifespan to some extent. There are also a few other details improved like changing the game currency to a value displayed rather than handfuls of cards.
